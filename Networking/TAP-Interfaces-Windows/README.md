# TAP Interfaces for Windows

## Overview
TAP (Terminal Access Point) interfaces are virtual network devices that provide a way to tunnel Ethernet frames. They are integral for using virtualization software like QEMU, Basilisk II, and SheepShaver for networking support.

TAP interfaces operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model, allowing for the emulation of a physical network interface. This capability enables access to various networking protocols beyond just IP, making it versatile for setups that require a broader range of network functionalities. In contrast, TUN interfaces operate at the network layer (Layer 3) and are limited to IP traffic, which means they can only handle packet forwarding based on IP addresses.

## Steps to Setup TAP Interfaces on Windows

1. **Install OpenVPN**:
   - Download and install OpenVPN from [OpenVPN's official site](https://openvpn.net/community-downloads/).
   - During the installation, ensure the TAP adapter is selected for installation.

2. **Create TAP Interfaces**:
   - Open Command Prompt with administrative privileges.
   - Use the following command to create multiple TAP interfaces:
     ```shell
     tapinstall.exe install "C:\Program Files\TAP-Windows\bin\TAP-Windows6.sys" tap0901
     tapinstall.exe install "C:\Program Files\TAP-Windows\bin\TAP-Windows6.sys" tap0902
     tapinstall.exe install "C:\Program Files\TAP-Windows\bin\TAP-Windows6.sys" tap0903
     tapinstall.exe install "C:\Program Files\TAP-Windows\bin\TAP-Windows6.sys" tap0904
     tapinstall.exe install "C:\Program Files\TAP-Windows\bin\TAP-Windows6.sys" tap0905
     ```

3. **Configure Networking**:
   - Make sure the TAP interfaces are properly configured in Windows.
   - You may need to set their IP addresses manually if required.

4. **Bridge TAP Interfaces with VMware Workstation**:
   - Open VMware Workstation and navigate to `Edit` -> `Virtual Network Editor`.
   - Select the NAT adapter and configure it to bridge with the created TAP interfaces.
   - Ensure that all TAP interfaces are added to the bridge.
   - Note: VirtualBox VMs will also select this interface as their networking interface.

5. **Ensure Isolation**:
   - The bridged interface should not run IPv4 or IPv6 services. This configuration helps isolate the host machine and prevent cross-networking issues between the host and the VMs.

## Conclusion
Using TAP interfaces provides greater flexibility and access to a range of networking protocols, making them a better choice than TUN interfaces for setups that require interaction beyond IP traffic.
